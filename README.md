# HKU Medtech Hackathon

Code for the arduino uno and gy521 gyroscope. The goal of the project is to notify nurses when patients have been in the same position for too long and therefore they are more likely to develop pressure wounds.

The overwhelming majority of the code was obtained from https://github.com/janaka/Gy521-Dev-Kit
